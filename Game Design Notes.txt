Do not penalize player for being caught with score, only with gameplay!



The AI reacting realistically to seeing you / not seeing you / hearing you / noticing things that have changed. The ability to approach situations in multiple ways.

I like to have a lot of variety in the way I control the player - leaning around corners, climbing over walls etc

use of both a lighting system in the 3D engine and sound system as a key part of the gameplay

Interesting level design, specifically a lot of alternate paths into a target building/level. If your goal is to infiltrate a mansion and plant a bug on a phone in the 2nd floor, there should be many ways into the mansion: running from neighboring buildings and onto the roof, sneaking in from underground via sewers, stealing a disguise and walking in through the front door, etc

being able to scale damn near everything, repelling Ozzy style down on a guy and snapping his neck, pulling them through the ice of a frozen lake you're swimming under them in, being able to deactivate/break a patrol's radio leaving back up inaccessible and allowing you to deal with them however you see fit

Open areas with multiple traversal methods

Level design that makes sense. Don't put some crates "over there" just to give me "options", don't make the guards patrol in 15 seconds long laps, don't make the civilian look out the window every 20 seconds... Don't try to make a boring place (like a back alley) interesting through such contrieved level design. Either replace it with something else or simply leave it as it is! Not every section of the level should be a stealth challenge... Tension and uneasiness can come from mixing up the levels with such uneventful locales. Also patience should always be rewarded. Random people or patrols should get bored and take a break, the cook in the kitchen should finish his damn meal, the man near the fireplace should fall asleep and so on. And if I'm told I'm not supposed to touch the street / kill some douchebag etc and I do it, please try and provide an alternative other than GAME OVER DERP.

it's always fun finding out half-way through a mission that you've been set-up, or that someone else has beaten you to the treasure and set off the alarm

If you get detected, you should have options to deal with the situation and enemies should react accordingly. Usually stealth games go one of two ways during detection; either you reload the last save and avoid the situation you ran into or you run away from enemies until they are no longer alerted and resume their normal activities. Both of these sequences are pretty unrealistic and immersion breaking. I would really like to see games focus more on tools to deal with being detected rather than just remaining completely undetected without becoming a full on action game.

And now to the last one. Shadow-based cover system. A light-gem is an absolute necessity for this mechanic. (shouldn't be copyrighted I believe). Except for Thief 4 which was basically "INVISIBLE" and "VISIBLE but let me just wait untill my discovery indicator fills up from 1 to 3 strikes over the course of a few seconds, before I am allowed to discover you", real shadow based stealth games like Thief 1-3 and the dark mod have ~12 different gradings to them. From a perfect shadow, which makes you invisible to the enemy to openly standing in the light, which makes the enemy immideatly discover you. In addition to that, if that wasn't clear enough it also basically subdivided the gradings to 3 different states: red, yellow and black. While you might get away with shortly being seen by less attentie guards in yellow and making them either make a concerned comment about rats or look over your way and then just mumble on, on red you are typically immideatly spotted. This might differ of course, if you have previously agitated that enemy. There are things like different alarm states, which may very well be permanent, often indicated by the AI walking around even more attentive and having their sword out for the rest of the level.

Sound also has an extremely and immensly important place in stealth mechanics. Let me just say it right now to get it out of the way. If you try to recreate thief's stealth mechanics in your game, without including things like footsteps for the player character and enemies and generally show the same lackluster attitude as basically every modern action game with complete indifference to whether the player runs up to an enemey, crosses a loud, clanky metal surface or silently walks up to one, then you failed and will probably get no attention from the stealth gamer community.

Gameplay loop:
- tasked with stealing a specific item from a location
- given an initial map which plots out where the item is and where guards will be positioned
- use map, tools, and awareness to sneak past guards without getting caught and steal the item

- first time spotted by guard, 911 is called and you have a countdown till police show up to patrol with guns
- if police see you they will chase and if you run they will shoot and kill you
- if enough time passes without being seen, police will leave


Guard interactions
- radio in every minute
- can be held at gunpoint and ziptied
  - won't radio in and other guards on same team (same color uniform) will come investigate
- power can be cut, lights are out til a guard comes to fix em


Stealable items
- name
- sprite
- $ value


Win mechanics
- need to steal a specific object or specific amount of stealables
- extra goals
  - never get caught, no alarms, found all stealables


Lose mechanics
- guard touches player
  - game over?
  - handcuff minigame
    - more enemies make it harder/less time to pull it off?
- guard sees player
  - if guard has walkie - radios other guards imediately and chases player
  - if guard doesn't - runs to nearest radio point
    - all guards within radius (if less than 3, up to 3 closest guards) run towards alerted guards location
    - radios can be disabled somehow?


Stealing mini-games
- lockpick
  - thumbsticks control torque wrench and pick
  - rumble, sound, and visuals indicate proper torque, pin, and height
  - keep enough torque and increase it as pins are picked
  - find correct next pin and get it to the correct height
- dial lock
  - thumbsticks control stethoscope and dial
  - find correct area to listen to for tumblers
  - alternate rotating directions
- paintings
  - thumstick controls angle of knife
  - thumbstick or trigger controls speed of knife
    - moving faster adds randomness to knife angle


Possible single-serve mechanics
- enforce strict inventory limits (only 3 tools?)
- gun with no bullets for intimidation
- whistle/rocks
  - once or twice per guard per minute is ok, too often they get suspicious and radio in
- peak through door locks
- realistic sounds to determine guard locations
- vents/pipes
- sneak/run speeds with different noise levels
- blueprint map that can be annotated before and during the level
  - guard rooms
  - guard placements
  - items of interest
- player 2 is a guard?
- when enemy leaves player sight, draw a figment of where they used to be
- when enemy moves outside player sight and can be hear, draw footprints
