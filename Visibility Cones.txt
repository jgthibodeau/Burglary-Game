2 different types of cones, visiblility and movement
a visible object has a percentage of itself that must be visible in order for it to be counted as seen

When an entity is in unaware state, it will poll all of its cones to see if there is anything of note
	Movement sensed builds up until the guard decides to investigate the area of the last movement
	Direct objects sensed build up based on current light level until the guard sees the object



Strong Direct & Weak Direct
	entity in these cone builds up awareness based off light level (lower level means slower buildup)

Strong Peripheral, Weak Peripheral, Back Peripheral
	entity movement in these cones builds up awareness based off speed (slower movement means slower buildup)



Ignore peripheral/sound if close enough to another guard, not alerted yet, and values are within that guards possible values


hearing a sound louder than a threshold imediately piques guards interest towards that area



2 levels for a guard to keep track of
	knowledge -> being close enough with enough light on you while in direct vision will give the guard full knowledge of your location
	interest -> piqued interest means the guard will go to and investigate a spot, spending more time the higher their interest is
				depending on frequency of piqued interest, the guard will go into a full investigation mode, ignoring their patrol and hunting down the player
	times interest piqued

	while interest has been piqued:
		the guard notes the position of the interesting location, and will investigate it
		when more interest is built up
			the interesting locations position is updated
			if the rate of buildup is high, it will be counted as a new interest piqued event

	guard behavior is dependent on the amount of times interest has been piqued and player has been actually seen

	being directly seen, or enough piqued interests will cause the guard to know there is an intruder and enter a full investiagtion mode

	guards investigation time will cool down as long as you remain out of sight

	(optional, test and see how it feels) as long as number of times interest has been piqued is kept below a threshold, they will go away after a time

	guard state, amount of times interest piqued, and if guard has seen player effect their senses


4 levels to keep track of on the player and noticable entitites
	distance - an ever present modifier to your visibility
			closer => faster buildups
			further => slower buildups

	light - dictates how easy it is for a guard to see you or notice your movement in their peripheral vision
			bright => imediate knowledge in direct sight, imediate detection of sudden movements
			dim => buildup detection till interest piqued, buildup detection of movements till interest piqued
			dark => invisible

	speed - dictates how easy it is for a guard to see you in his peripheral vision, as long as there is sufficient light
			fast => imediate interest piqued
			moderate => buildup till interest piqued
			slow = invisible

	sound - above a threshold will imediately pique interest of a guard
			movement speed affects the noises you naturally make
			can whistle to produce a loud sound at your position
			thrown items make a loud sound at the position they collide into another object based on their velocity

			too many piqued interests close together will put guard into an investigate state
