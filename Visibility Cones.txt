2 different types of cones, visiblility and movement
a visible object has a percentage of itself that must be visible in order for it to be counted as seen

When an entity is in unaware state, it will poll all of its cones to see if there is anything of note
	Movement sensed builds up until the guard decides to investigate the area of the last movement
	Direct objects sensed build up based on current light level until the guard sees the object



Strong Direct & Weak Direct
	entity in these cone builds up awareness based off light level (lower level means slower buildup)

Strong Peripheral, Weak Peripheral, Back Peripheral
	entity movement in these cones builds up awareness based off speed (slower movement means slower buildup)
